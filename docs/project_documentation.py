SoloDungeon Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the SoloDungeon project, including its structure, functionality, and development process.

Backend Development
-------------------

Character Class Development:
- Python classes for each D&D race, class, and background are defined in the files `races.py`, `classes.py`, and `backgrounds.py` respectively.

Character Creation Logic:
- A system to calculate base stats based on race and class is implemented in `base_stats.py`.
- Logic for character traits and abilities selection is developed in `traits_abilities.py`.
- Functions for character appearance customization are created in `appearance.py`.

Game Mechanics Implementation:
- The health and mana systems are coded in `health_mana.py`.
- The experience point calculation and leveling up algorithms are developed in `experience_leveling.py`.
- The inventory management system including item categorization is created in `inventory.py`.

Flask Application Setup:
- The Flask app is structured with Blueprints for different game aspects in `app.py`.
- Error handling and logging are set up in the same file.

API Development:
- Endpoints for character creation, retrieval, update, deletion, inventory management, and skill upgrades are defined and implemented in `character.py`, `inventory.py`, and `authentication.py`.

Database Integration
--------------------

DynamoDB Configuration:
- AWS credentials are set up with IAM for secure access in `dynamodb_config.py`.
- DynamoDB tables for characters, inventory, and game states are defined and created in the same file.

Database Schema Design:
- Detailed schemas for each table are designed in `characters.py`, `inventory.py`, and `game_states.py`.

CRUD Operation Implementation:
- Python functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in DynamoDB are written in `characters.py`, `inventory.py`, and `game_states.py`.

Frontend Development
--------------------

React Project Structuring:
- The React project is organized into components, services, and utilities directories.
- Routing for different pages is set up in `App.js`.

Character Customization UI:
- Form components with validation for character creation are designed in `CharacterCreationForm.js`.
- Dynamic dropdowns for race and class selection are implemented in `RaceClassDropdown.js`.
- Input fields for character names, traits, and appearances are created in `CharacterNameTraits.js`.

Main Game UI Development:
- The layout for the main game interface is designed in `MainGameInterface.js`.
- Interactive maps and quest logs are implemented in `InteractiveMap.js` and `QuestLog.js` respectively.
- Dialogue box components for story progression are developed in `DialogueBox.js`.

Backend Integration:
- Services in React for making API calls are developed in `api.js`.
- API responses are handled to update the UI in the same file.
- State management for game data is implemented in `gameData.js`.

Enhancements and Overhauls
--------------------------

Character Module Refinement:
- Character classes are enhanced with advanced traits and feats in `character_module.py`.
- A more dynamic character progression system is implemented in the same file.

Game Mechanics Enhancement:
- Additional elements like fatigue, morale, and environmental effects are introduced in `game_mechanics.py`.
- A more intricate skill tree and ability upgrade system are developed in the same file.

API Functionality Expansion:
- Existing API endpoints are enhanced for more complex data handling in `api.py`.
- New endpoints for advanced game interactions like quests and events are developed in the same file.

DynamoDB Data Layer Enhancement:
- Data access is optimized with advanced queries and data modeling in `dynamodb.py`.
- Efficient data caching mechanisms are implemented in the same file.

Testing and Debugging
---------------------

Unit Testing:
- Unit tests for Python modules are written in `backend.py`.
- Unit tests for React components are developed in `frontend.js`.

Integration Testing:
- The integration between frontend, backend, and database is tested in `integration.py`.

Documentation
-------------

Code Documentation:
- The Python and React codebase is documented in `code_documentation.py`.

Project Documentation:
- This document maintains clear documentation of the API endpoints and database schema.
- The README is regularly updated with project progress, features, and setup instructions in `README.md`.
