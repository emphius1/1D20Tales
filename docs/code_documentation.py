SoloDungeon Code Documentation

This file provides a high-level overview of the codebase for SoloDungeon, a D&D inspired game.

Backend Development
-------------------

1. Character Class Development:
    - Python classes for each D&D race, class, and background are defined in `races.py`, `classes.py`, and `backgrounds.py` respectively.

2. Character Creation Logic:
    - A system to calculate base stats based on race and class is implemented in `base_stats.py`.
    - Logic for character traits and abilities selection is developed in `traits_abilities.py`.
    - Functions for character appearance customization are created in `appearance.py`.

3. Game Mechanics Implementation:
    - Health and mana systems are coded in `health_mana.py`.
    - Experience point calculation and leveling up algorithms are developed in `experience_leveling.py`.
    - The inventory management system including item categorization is created in `inventory.py`.

4. Flask Application Setup:
    - The Flask app is structured with Blueprints for different game aspects in `app.py`.
    - Blueprints for characters, inventory, and combat are set up in `characters.py`, `inventory.py`, and `combat.py` respectively.

5. API Development:
    - Endpoints for character creation, retrieval, update, and deletion are defined and implemented in `character.py`.
    - Endpoints for inventory management and skill upgrades are developed in `inventory.py`.
    - Authentication and authorization for API access is implemented in `authentication.py`.

Database Integration
--------------------

1. DynamoDB Configuration:
    - AWS credentials are set up with IAM for secure access in `dynamodb_config.py`.
    - DynamoDB tables for characters, inventory, and game states are defined and created in the same file.

2. Database Schema Design:
    - Detailed schemas for each table are designed in `schemas.py`.

3. CRUD Operation Implementation:
    - Python functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in DynamoDB are written in `crud_operations.py`.

Frontend Development
--------------------

1. React Project Structuring:
    - The React project is organized into components, services, and utilities directories.

2. Character Customization UI:
    - Form components with validation for character creation are designed in `CharacterCreationForm.js`.
    - Dynamic dropdowns for race and class selection are implemented in `RaceClassDropdown.js`.
    - Input fields for character names, traits, and appearances are created in `CharacterNameTraits.js`.

3. Main Game UI Development:
    - The layout for the main game interface is designed in `MainGameInterface.js`.
    - Interactive maps and quest logs are implemented in `InteractiveMap.js` and `QuestLog.js` respectively.
    - Dialogue box components for story progression are developed in `DialogueBox.js`.

4. Backend Integration:
    - Services in React for making API calls are developed in `api.js`.
    - API responses are handled to update the UI in the same file.
    - State management for game data is implemented in `gameData.js`.

Enhancements and Overhauls
--------------------------

1. Character Module Refinement:
    - Character classes are enhanced with advanced traits and feats in `character_module.py`.

2. Game Mechanics Enhancement:
    - Additional elements like fatigue, morale, and environmental effects are introduced in `game_mechanics.py`.

3. API Functionality Expansion:
    - Existing API endpoints are enhanced for more complex data handling in `api.py`.

4. DynamoDB Data Layer Enhancement:
    - Data access is optimized with advanced queries and data modeling in `dynamodb.py`.

Testing and Debugging
---------------------

1. Unit Testing:
    - Unit tests for Python modules are written in `backend.py`.
    - Unit tests for React components are developed in `frontend.js`.

2. Integration Testing:
    - The integration between frontend, backend, and database is tested in `integration.py`.
