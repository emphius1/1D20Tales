# API Documentation

This document outlines the structure and endpoints of our API.

## Structure

Our API is divided into three main components:

1. **Routes:** These are the endpoints that our API exposes. Each route corresponds to a specific functionality of our application.

2. **Controllers:** These are the functions that handle requests coming to our routes. They contain the business logic of our application.

3. **Models:** These are the data structures that our application uses. They define the schema for our database tables and the format of our request and response bodies.

## Endpoints

At this stage, the specific endpoints of our API are yet to be defined. They will be added here as they are developed.

## Dependencies

Our API depends on Flask, a Python micro web framework. The dependency is specified in the `package.json` file in the `backend` directory.

## Future Work

The development of our API is ongoing. This document will be updated as more components and endpoints are added.
