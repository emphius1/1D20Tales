# Initial Project Structure and Configuration Tasks

This project is structured into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

## Frontend

The frontend directory is currently a placeholder, with further development pending.

## Backend

The backend directory is divided into several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `ai`: This directory will contain scripts related to AI integration.
- `api`: This directory is structured into `routes`, `controllers`, and `models` for organized API development.
- `content`: This directory is reserved for future use.
- `database`: This directory contains `db_config.py` for database configuration and `schema.sql` for defining the database schema.
- `game_logic`: This directory contains `combat_system.py` and `character_model.py` for game mechanics development.
- `helpers`: This directory contains `utilities.py` for backend utility functions.
- `integrations`: This directory contains `payment_gateway_integration.py` for future payment gateway integration.

## Root Directory Configurations

The root directory contains several configuration and documentation files:

- `.gitignore`: This file contains Node.js and React ignore patterns.
- `package.json`: This file is located in the `backend` directory and lists Flask as a dependency.
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`: This file outlines the coding standards for this project.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project structure and configuration tasks.
- `LICENSE`: This file contains the project's license.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: This file provides guidelines for contributing to the project.
- `SECURITY.md`: This file outlines the project's security policy.
- `.env.example`: This file is located in the `backend` directory and serves as a template for environment variables.

## Documentation

Each backend subdirectory contains a `README.md` file for documentation:

- `backend/api/README.md`: This file will detail the future API structure and endpoints.
- `backend/database/README.md`: This file will document the database schema and configurations.
- `backend/game_logic/README.md`: This file will explain the game mechanics and rules.
- `backend/ai/README.md`: This file will outline the AI integration approach.
