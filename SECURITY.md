# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

We take security bugs in our project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

The project team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process. The role of primary handler is not fixed and will be assigned on a case-by-case basis.

The bug is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still under maintenance. These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.
