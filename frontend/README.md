# Second Pass Instructions

This project is a React-based frontend for a game with a Dungeon Master interface. It interacts with the backend APIs to provide a dynamic and immersive user experience.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd frontend
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the application, run:

```
npm start
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Structure

The main components of the frontend are located in the `src/components` directory. Each component corresponds to a specific part of the user interface.

- `DungeonMaster.js`: This component handles the Dungeon Master interface, including the display of dynamic combat narratives and player interactions.
- `Player.js`: This component handles the player interface, including the display of character states, inventory, and available actions.

The application state is managed using React's built-in state management, with context provided at the top level of the application.

## Interactions

The frontend interacts with the backend through a series of API calls, defined in `src/api.js`. These calls include fetching game state, submitting player actions, and receiving updates from the Dungeon Master.

The frontend updates dynamically in response to changes in game state, providing a real-time, interactive experience for the user.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the frontend may include more detailed character interfaces, additional player actions, and improved Dungeon Master narratives.
